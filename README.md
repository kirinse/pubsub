# pubsub

Pubsub is a package that allows you to create publishers and subscribers for a range of different types. Currently only Kafka is fully implemented, and RabbitMQ has the publisher implemented. This is loosely based on Gizmo's implementation but with using Segment IO instead of Sarama due to the need of queue group functionality.
